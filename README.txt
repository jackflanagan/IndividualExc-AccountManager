Account-Manager Application
Technologies used:

Java EE

Java EE was used as the backend of the application. Entity was used to create the database, persistence was used so that we could talk to the database, business logic was also included however in this application it is basically calling the methods

WildFly

This was used to host the application on the server on the port 8080

HTML, Bootstrap, JS

These technologies were used for the front end of the application. A boostrap was used for the base design much like a template this saved me time creating the front end from scratch. HTML is the basic framework this sits on and is an easy to understand languange therefore was my choice. Javascript was chosen because of the flexibility of its function so that many things can be done achieved.

Jquery and Ajax

Jquery and Ajax allowed me to communicate with the back end API therefore linking the front to the back. Through these technologies I could execute HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE threfore making changes to the database and retrieving information. I used these technologies because they can be easy implemented in javascript and the script sources can be added to the html head.
